# Quantum-Random-Forest
The model is based off the paper Srikumar et al., "A kernel-based quantum random forest for improved classification", (2022). The code is intended for research purposes and the development of proof of concepts. For questions about the code and its use in the paper, please email maiyuren.s@gmail.com for clarification.
